This report style is to present the result of a brainstorming session using Nominal Group Technique (NGT).

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_group_technique for NGT.

How to use Zenta during the session:

 - Create a Sketch. Assign a property to it with the key 'objectClass', and value 'NGTresult'.

 - In the "sharing ideas" step record each idea on a sticky.

 - In the "group discussion" step organize stickies hierarchically. If idea A is considered to be a subset/instance of idea B, then place A within B. If A and B are in the same group, place them inside the same (possibly newly created) sticky. 

 - In the "voting and ranking" step place an element (we have only actor right now, it is okay) on the sketch. Each vote is represented by a connection between the element and a "main" sticky (which is not inside another one0.

Do not use connections for other purposes.


Presentation:

For each sketch having the NGTresult objectClass, a table is written.
Rows represent a "main" sticky. The first cell contains the ranking (number of connections associated with) the idea.
In the second cell you can find the content of the sticky. If there are more stickies inside the main one, they are presented hierarchically in a list.


possible enhancements (notify me if you want them, and I may implement it)

- We might have a label for a sticky. E.g. if there is a "::" in the contents, then everything before it is the label. it could be displayed in a column.
- We might allow connections between elements, by designating one connection type to votes (so the others could be used for other purposes.
- (It needs additional code in Zenta) The stickies in the sketch could be automatically turned into archimate elements. By using properties cleverly, even a mapping from sticky color to folder and element type could be done.
