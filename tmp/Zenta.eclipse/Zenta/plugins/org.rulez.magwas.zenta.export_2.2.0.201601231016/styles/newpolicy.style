	This style generates a policy from the model, and checks the model against the policy.
	This is useful for generating policy files and conformance checking a model which contains the metamodel against you want to check conformance.
	The default policy is generated from the Styledhtml model, and contains the definition for the objects needed to generate policy and more.
