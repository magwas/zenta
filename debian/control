Description: metamodel-aware architecture modeling tool
 Zenta is a free, open source, cross-platform tool and editor
 to create models along with their metamodels.

 Zenta is targeted toward all levels of Architects and Modellers.
 It is intended to provide a low cost to entry (i.e. free) solution
 to users who may be making their first steps in the architecture
 modelling or who are looking for a cross-platform modelling tool
 for their company or institution.

 Zenta boasts an export module which can export your model
 theoretically in any format, and does have styles to do it in
 docbook, html, opendoc and csv.

 The export module also does conformance checks to your metamodels.

 Metamodels are easily expressed with graphical models.
